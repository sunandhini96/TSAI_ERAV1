## Task 2:  

Our goal in this project is to use an image-based map of a city with roads and a car within this environment. 

There are two main objectives:

Keep the car on the roads as much as possible: Ensure the car stays on the designated roads within the city map. If the car moves onto other areas (not roads), it should be guided back to the road.

Reach the goal in the fewest steps: Guide the car to a specified destination within the city map using the roads available. The aim is to reach this destination as quickly as possible, minimizing the number of steps (or moves) taken by the car to reach the goal.

In simple terms, I want the car to stick to the roads and navigate efficiently to reach the desired destination within the city map. This involves keeping the car on the roads and steering it toward the goal in the fewest moves possible.
